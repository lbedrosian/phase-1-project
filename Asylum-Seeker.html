    <p>Loaded up the car about 0900 and hit the road for the great mountains of West Virginia. I’ve planned this trip for the past month and have had dreams of waking up on the mountain side with a nice cup of hot coffee. After my drive through a small town and having both hands on the wheel due to high winds, I finally arrived at the top of the mountain and it was dark and gray skies with freezing cold rain falling down from the sky. I zipped up my jacket grabbed my bag from the trunk and hit play on spotify as I hit the trail for 3 days and 2 nights, little did I know that it was going to be an adventure that would change my life.

        I was walking in soaking wet socks as I slipped down the side of a 20 foot hill and picked myself, up to this point it was an amazing walk. A beautiful creek, yellow trees everywhere, and lil animal tracks all over the mud. As I realize what I've gotten myself into I decided to keep going but to cut my trip short by a day. The weather was just too bad to continue. Walking on, I realized on my map that I would have to cross a creek that I had shrugged off. Once I saw it though, it made my stomach go in a note. This was no little river. This river had rapids that reached across 40 to 50 feet in length and had no way around it. From watching a little movie called “Into the wild” I learned to take my shoes off and put on my chakos so when I crossed, I could have drier shoes. Made it across with numbing feet, but a smile on my face so big it made me yell for joy in the mountains. I saw the mountain I had to climb ahead of me and put on my shoes and took it one step at a time. Looking back at it now, it was very dumb that I took this climb. I slipped multiple times, the wind was blowing astronomically, and I couldn't feel my nose or hands. Making it to the top was the greatest feeling ever, I did it, I was the king of the world. As the sun set I forgot to grab water in the rapids so with no other source around, I had to walk back down the mountain to scoop water up and climb all the way back in the soaking wet air. Getting back to the top with 3 liters of water was nice but it was hard to handle my joy when the winds were blowing crazy speeds. I couldn't track it but it sure was enough to blow the tent over before going back down the mountain. I started to boil water on my cooking set but couldn't get a fire going for warmth. The sun was gone and all I had to do was sleep in my soaking wet clothes. Tossing in the night I realized that this adventure wasn't for me and at the first site of light I would run down the mountain back to my car. 
        
            Packing everything up was very exciting, all I could image was the hot air blowing in my car and my boots off. I got half way down the mountain when all of a sudden I split 20-30 feet down a cliff and hill. I was frozen and honestly thought to be dead. I moved my face out of the mud and checked myself for any broken bones, Lord willing I was perfectly fine besides losing my nalgene, both maps, and a compass. I then found myself in the middle of nowhere with no way of finding a trail. It was about 1300 now and all I accomplished for finding a trail was nowhere on site. I found myself sitting on top of a rock on the rapids trying to start a fire just so I could warm myself just a little. Crying for help, blowing a whistle, I truly felt lost. I said screw it and took to the other side of the rapids where my car was parked on top of the other mountain. This was a steep steep climb and it was not fun, for the most part I was on all fours crawling through thick trees and vines that stretch the length of a football field. At this point I found myself stuck in the vines at night, all I knew I could do was cry for help again, again, and again. I truly was in an area where if I lost cationess from dehydrating, I would have never been heard from again. I was scared, crying with tears down my face, and thoughts and memories of my family flashing between the broken branches in my face. I ended up rolling out my sleeping bag under a tree I found and just tried to get some sleep. It was an easier sleep than the night before due to being so out of energy. I woke up the next morning and found a creek. I continued to crawl until I fell a little down 3 feet to where at the foot was a creek with flowing water. I was able to scoop water up and filter it with a little tool I bought at Rei. I prayed and tried to make breakfast while I looked for a while out. I packed everything up and found a trail just 10 feet from the creek. I was so happy, I basically ran down the trail because I recognized it from the trail I first came across day one as one I had to turn onto. 
        
            This was a short summary of the trip I went on for my birthday. With almost dying multiple times and not knowing if I would ever be found again I was able to find my car, call my mom and tell her how much I love her.
